# Next Level

Next Level is a Monday app that allows construction project managers and real estate agents collect research and analyze data and communicate with architects and engineers faster.

### Why

Construction is one of the largest growing industries in America- in fact, it is projected to grow to an upwards of 1.4 trillion USD by 2024. However, despite the rapid growth of this industry, the technology development in this industry is limited.

After interviewing civil engineering students, we realized the lack of fast and intuitive software that would allow construction managers to select plots of land to build on. Currently, construction managers often rely on excel in order to sift through potential lots to build on. This is time consuming as well as labor intensive.

After compiling a list of features that would be helpful to construction managers, we set out to build software that would empower them to expedite their work flow. We built features inside of Monday, a software platform that empowers teams to do more with their project management software. We implemented relevant features that would empower construction managers to lead better and more productive building tasks.

### Features

-   CAD model visualization and annotation
-   Managers/engineers can upload CAD models directly on Monday
-   Monday shares the models with the entire team
-   Comment and review models directly in a Monday board
-   Predict the cost of the project based on various building materials
-   Graphical property comparisons
    -   Automatically fetch data from reliable MLS data providers like Zillow to the Monday board
    -   View and predict pricing history of every property on the board
    -   Track cost trends with calendar views
-   Detect anomalous data
    -   Use machine learning algorithms to detect exceptional or unusual properties
    -   Use this to find a diamond in the rough from the data
-   Load data directly onto a map
    -   Instantly get Zillow pricing estimates by adding properties on Monday
    -   No data cleaning necessary
    -   Completely compatible with other Monday features and integrations

### TODO (future features)

-   Gather data from more MLS providers
-   Add more fine-tuned integrations
-   Negotiate with Monday for higher complexity limits
-   Add item views to graph every item
-   Add data normalization to graph views
