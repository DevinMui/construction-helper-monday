# Template

---

Template for a basic React Monday app.

`npm run start` to start a ngrok server instance

`npm run stop` to stop all running server instances

`./build_monday.sh` to create an uploadable zip file (located outside this directory)

**DO NOT STORE `.env` VARIABLES IN WIDGET FOLDERS**. They will be included in git.
